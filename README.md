# My Aim

Accuracy paradox is a common problem we face while dealing with imbalanced data. Through this notebook my primary aim is to tackle class imbalance problem using oversampling techniques to build a model that will help the banking institution in making better decisions. As per the problem statement provided I have chosen Recall to evaluate my model.

# Banking-Dataset - Marketing Targets

This particular dataset has been taken from Kaggle, I have added the link below for everyone's reference as well.

# Problem Statement

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

# About the Data

The data is related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed by the customer or not. The data folder contains two datasets:-

train.csv: 45,211 rows and 18 columns ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010)
test.csv: 4521 rows and 18 columns with 10% of the examples (4521), randomly selected from train.csv
